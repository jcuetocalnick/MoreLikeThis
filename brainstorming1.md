GoodReads 
- I like to have a search-bar where I can search for any books that I like and learn a little bit more about that book, who wrote it , how many pages it has and all.
- I like the rating feauture you can rate the book from starts (1-5) and also leave a written review , it helps a lot when you want to choose what to read .
- I also like the feauture where you can bookmark books that you want to read , currently reading and read.



Trails 

- I like trails because it accesses your phone's locations and shows the nearest trails around you so you can go hiking .
- I also like that before you begin the trail you can hit the start button and it will track how long the trail took you , your phase , the weather and it will draw on the map the expected path and the path that you take in case you get lost.
- At the end of the trail you can confirm you are done  you can add reviews , pictures and post it on social media as well .


Libby 

- I like that I can add my library card # and check out millions of books in pdf , epub format as well as audiobooks all for free.
- If an a book that you like is currently borrowed by somoene else you can join a waitlist and it will tell you how many days or weeks it will take for you to have the book.

UberEats

- I like that I can see pictures of most of the dishes of restaurants, that way I'll know if I may like the food that the restaurant I chose offers.
- I like that you can track the order's lyfe cycle, in other words, from when the order was placed through when the driver delivers the food.
- I like that I am able to contact the driver in case I have concerns or special instructions regarding the delivery.

Spotify

- I like that the app creates an album for me of my favorites songs, based on my daily played songs.
- I like that it provides the lyrics of the song that I'm currently listening too.
- I like that I can search albums by their music genre.

GuitarTuna

- I like that I can change the instrument that I'm tunning at the moment(Acoustic guitar, Electric guitar, Ukelele, Violin, Bass, etc).
- I like that it provides the lyrics along with the chords of songs that I search.
- I like that they provide classess to learn how to play guitar.

OfferUp

- I really enjoy the simplicity of the main page with the search bar on top and how it lays out relevent products in a 3 column style showing only the picture for simplicity while also providing specifications once a picture is selected.
- I also think that having the you are able to filter by distance to only see relevant products near you.
- Having 4 disctict tabs at the bootom for your home, inbox, post, and listings gives the app a really simple way to understand and navigate it.

Reddit

- I like the ability to join communities (subreddits) of interest and those will feed into your home feed.
- I like how you are able to go into each post and share ideas and comments with others of similar interest.
- I like how easy it is post something and receive feed back from the community regarding your post or question.

Hevy

- I like the ability to create your own work outs and track your weekly progrss or even use someone elses posted workout.
- An awesme feature is how Hevy acts like a social media platform for working out so you can follow your friends and see how they did and what they are lifting for that week.
- I also really like how if there is a recommended workout and you are unsure of how to properly execute it, a gif will show your what the proper full range motion should look like.
